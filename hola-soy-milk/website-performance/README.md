**Intentional Bottlenecks Introduced:**

1. **Deliberately Slow-Loading Image:**
    - The class `.slow-image` is added to a div with a background image (`high-res-image.jpg`), simulating slow image loading.
2. **Intentionally Delayed JavaScript Execution:**
    - JavaScript execution is delayed by 3 seconds, introducing intentional lag.
3. **Slow Third-Party Widget:**
    - A third-party widget is loaded with a delay of 5 seconds, simulating slow loading.
