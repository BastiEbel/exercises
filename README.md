## Receiving Feedback

### Remember, Feedback is a Gift

Someone has taken the time to give you (hopefully constructive) feedback.

But remember, just because they have offered said feedback, does not mean you have to take it. Maybe your opinion differs from theirs. Being able to articulate why you won't take it in a constructive manner and thanking the reviewer for their feedback is critical.


## Giving Feedback

### Be Kind, Not Nice

Leaving a review that just says "Hey this is great üëç, no notes" is not nearly as helpful as saying "Hey great work, here's how it can be even better" is amazing

### Point Out Lines of Code That Are Great, Not Just the Ones That Needs Improvement

Remember, feedback is both positive and contstructive!
